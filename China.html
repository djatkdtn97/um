      emerged as one of the world's first civilizations, in the fertile basin of the Yellow River in the North China Plain.
      For millennia, China's political system was based on hereditary monarchies, or dynasties, beginning with the semi-mythical Xia dynasty in 21st century BCE.</p>
    <p>China is a unitary one-party socialist republic and is one of the few existing socialist states.
      Political dissidents and human rights groups have denounced and criticized the Chinese government for human rights abuses,
      suppression of religious and ethnic minorities, censorship and mass surveillance, and cracking down on protests such as in 1989.
      The Chinese government says that the right to subsistence and economic development is a prerequisite to other types of human rights
      and that the notion of human rights should take into account a country's present economic level.</p>
