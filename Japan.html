    <p style=margin-top:40px;><strong><u><a href="https://www.japan.go.jp/" target="_blank" title="Japan officla website">Japan</a></u></strong> divided into 47 prefectures and traditionally into eight regions.
       Approximately two-thirds of the country's terrain is mountainous and heavily forested, and less than one-eighth of its land is suitable for agriculture.
       Consequently, Japan is among the most densely populated and urbanized countries in the world.
       The largest urban area is the metropolitan area centered on the capital city of Tokyo,
       which is the most populous in the world. Japan itself is the world's eleventh most populous country.</p>
    <p>Today, Japan is a member of the United Nations, the OECD, the G7, and the G20.
      Although it has officially renounced its right to declare war, Japan maintains a modern military for peacekeeping and self-defense,
      which has been ranked as the world's fourth most powerful. Following World War II,
      Japan experienced record economic growth to become the world's second-largest economy by 1980.</p>
    <p>Today, Japan's economy is the world's third-largest by nominal GDP and fourth-largest by purchasing power parity;
      it is also the fourth-largest importer and exporter and a global leader in the automotive and electronics industries.
      Japan is ranked "very high" on the Human Development Index; its population enjoys high levels of education and
      the second-highest life expectancy in the world, though it currently is experiencing a projected decline due to low birth rates.
      Culturally, Japan is renowned for its art, cuisine, literature, cinema, music, and popular culture.</P>
