      <strong>East Asia</strong> is the eastern subregion of Asia, which is defined in both geographical and ethno-cultural terms.
      The region consists of China, Hong Kong, Macao, Mongolia, North Korea, South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan.
      The East Asian states China, North Korea, South Korea, and Taiwan are all unrecognized by at least one other East Asian state.
      Hong Kong and Macau are officially highly autonomous but are under effective Chinese sovereignty.
      North Asia borders East Asia's north, Southeast Asia the south, South Asia the southwest, and Central Asia the west.
      To the east is the Pacific Ocean, and to the southeast is Micronesia (a Pacific Ocean island group, classified as part of Oceania).
    </p>
    <p>
      East Asians comprise around 1.7 billion people, making up about 38% of the population in Continental Asia and 22% of the global population.
      The region is home to major world metropolises such as Beijing, Hong Kong, Seoul, Shanghai, Taipei, and Tokyo.
      Although the coastal and riparian areas of the region form one of the world's most populated places,
      the population in Mongolia and Western China, both landlocked areas, is very sparsely distributed,
      with Mongolia having the lowest population density of a sovereign state.
      The overall population density of the region is 133 inhabitants per square kilometre (340/sq mi),
      about three times the world average of 45/km2 (120/sq mi).
